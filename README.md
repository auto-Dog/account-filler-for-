A programme that can automaticially copy the account&amp;password according to currrent time. Good news for laziers like me_(:∠-)_

A txt database contines all the infomation of my online course(e.g. name,account). And the prog. ec2 is to copy the account and password for me. On a rushing morning with 8:00 online course, what I need to do is: shut down the noisy alarm, get asleeeeep again and... well, the prog. automaticly starts when the computer boosts up(just put it in shell:startup), then press ctrl+V at account input box, then press any key to continue so the password can also be copied.

#features:
1.using a time code(XXXX,weekday num+hour value) to find corresponding lesson infomation.
2.automaticialy acquires present time to deliever a time code, so you don't actually need to convert it.
3.some warnings are set to make the prog. "stronger"
4.just a basic little programme...waiting for futher development /· ω ·/
